              Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has already shown how a wide range of
              cryptocurrencies, commodities, indices, stocks, and more can be
              represented on-chain as NFTs backed by real off-chain assets or
              collateralized synthetic tokens that provide exposure to
              underlying assets without actual ownership. Chainlink has been
              right at the heart of these DeFi markets, provisioning price
              oracles for each of these asset types. This has allowed new
              products and markets to be quickly launched in areas like
              lending/borrowing, derivatives, asset management, and more.
              Chainlink is now bringing a new asset class on-chain: real estate.
              The real estate industry alone is vast, expected to grow from
              $2687.35 billion in 2020 to $3717.03 billion in 2025. Not only can
              real estate assets be digitized on blockchains as tokens, but
              hybrid smart contracts can apply logic to their usage on-chain,
              such as for trading against benchmarks, using as collateral for a
              loan, enabling prediction markets based on industry trends, or
              supporting passive yields through decentralized ETFs that serve as
              on-chain liquidity. In the following tutorial, we showcase how
              developers can use Chainlink oracles today to get high-quality
              data on-chain regarding residential real estate valuations. This
              involves access to two premium data providers.
